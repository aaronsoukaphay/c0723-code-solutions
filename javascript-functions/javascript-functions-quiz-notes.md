## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  a way to store reusable code, making the code more dynamic and easier to read
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  this includes the function keyword, function name, parameters, opening curly brace, optional return statment, closing curly brace
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  includes the function name and arguments that are passed through the function
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  a function definition has parameters and a code block that will execute code once the function is called
  a function call has arguments that will be passed through the function and replace the parameters
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  parameters are temporary placeholders in the function definition. once the function is called, arguments are passed through the function and replace the parameters
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  parameters allow the function to be more dynamic because it can take on the values of arguments that were passed when the function is called
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  it causes the function to produce a value and stops the code from executing (exits the function)
