- How do you define a component in React?
  export the component with export default, define the function where first letter of function name is capital, and add HTML-like markup (JSX)
- How is a component "rendered" (made visible on the browser page)?
  React applications begin at a root component, which is what will be injected into the HTML document. React generates HTML automatically from react components, allowing the app to show content before the JavaScript code loads
