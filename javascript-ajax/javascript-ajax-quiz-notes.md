  Asynchronous Javascript And XML
- Which object is built into the browser for making HTTP requests in JavaScript?
  XMLHttpRequest
- What event is fired by `XMLHttpRequest` objects when they are finished loading the data from the server?
  load
- **Bonus Question**: An `XMLHttpRequest` object has an `addEventListener()` method just like DOM elements. How is it possible that they both share this functionality?
